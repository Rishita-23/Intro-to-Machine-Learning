# 🚀 Intro to Machine Learning — Project Portfolio

## 📌 Overview
This repository is a **growing portfolio of Machine Learning projects** built while learning ML concepts from the ground up.  
It focuses on **practical understanding, clean implementation, and correct use of algorithms**, rather than treating ML as a black box.

Projects range from **basic models** to **real-world datasets**, and the repository will continue to expand as new topics are learned.

## 🎯 What This Repository Demonstrates
- Strong foundation in Machine Learning fundamentals  
- Hands-on experience with **regression and classification problems**  
- Proper data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Clear understanding of **model assumptions, evaluation, and limitations**  
- Ability to scale from simple examples to real-world datasets

## ⚙️ Common Machine Learning Workflow
Most projects in this repository follow a structured ML pipeline:

1. Problem Understanding  
2. Data Exploration & Cleaning  
3. Feature Engineering  
4. Model Selection  
5. Training & Evaluation  
6. Interpretation of Results  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  
- Statsmodels  
- Jupyter Notebook  

Additional tools and libraries may be introduced as projects become more advanced.

## 📈 Learning Philosophy
This repository emphasizes:
- **Conceptual clarity over complexity**  
- **Explainability over blind optimization**  
- **Progressive learning through implementation**  

Models may start simple and evolve as new ML concepts are learned and applied.
